  exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table) is a Microsoft file system
  introduced in 2006 optimized for flash memory such as USB flash
  drives and SD cards.[5] It is proprietary and Microsoft owns patents
  on several elements of its design.[2]

  exFAT can be used where the NTFS file system is not a feasible
  solution (due to data structure overhead), yet the file size limit
  of the standard FAT32 file system (i.e. 4 GiB) remains in those
  scenarios.

  exFAT has been adopted by the SD Card Association as the default
  file system for SDXC cards larger than 32 GiB.
