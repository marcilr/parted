exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table) is a Microsoft file system
introduced in 2006 optimized for flash memory such as USB flash
drives and SD cards.[5] It is proprietary and Microsoft owns patents
on several elements of its design.[2]

exFAT can be used where the NTFS file system is not a feasible
solution (due to data structure overhead), yet the file size limit
of the standard FAT32 file system (i.e. 4 GiB) remains in those
scenarios.

exFAT has been adopted by the SD Card Association as the default
file system for SDXC cards larger than 32 GiB.

Format exFAT parition
=====================
To format a partition, use mkexfatfs / mkfs.exfat like with
most filesystems, e.g.:

  mkfs.exfat /dev/sdX1

As for creating the partition in the first place, this is
the same as for any other filesystem. Create a partition
in your favourite partition manager.  If you have a MBR
partition type, set its type to NTFS (that is code 7).
