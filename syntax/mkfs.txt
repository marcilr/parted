mkfs - build a Linux filesystem


mkfs [options] [-t type] [fs-options] device [size]


mkfs is used to build a Linux filesystem on a device,  usually  a  hard
disk partition.  The device argument is either the device name (e.g.
/dev/hda1, /dev/sdb2), or a regular file that shall contain the
filesystem.  The size argument is the number of blocks to be used for
the filesystem.

The exit code returned by mkfs is 0 on success and 1 on failure.


Examples
========
Format partitions on usb key:

# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
# mkfs.exfat /dev/sdb2
